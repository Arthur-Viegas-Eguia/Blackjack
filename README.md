# Blackjack
Final project delivered for the subject of data structures.  Follows all the prompts: at least 3 classes having at least 2 subclasses and one superclass, use of concepts seen in class (such as sorting), being a game, among others.
## Overview:
The program models a simplified version of a game of blackjack as it has no splits nor insurance. It has all the game's operations and follows the standard rules. With this program you can:
- Choose how much money you are arriving at the table with
- Choose how much you want to bet before each round is played
- Choose whether you want to be dealt a new card or hold while playing
- Having the computer making simple strategies while playing against you
- Having the computer autoatically decide who won the game based on the blackajck rules
- Having the amount of money you have updated based on whether you won/lost the round

## Usage:
To use the program, you have to compile and run the code after downloading. To do this, simply
type in the terminal:
```
javac *.java
java Blackjack value
```
Where value represents the amount of money you have when you enter the game. Value must be
an integer number greater than 0. All money/betting related operations depend on this value.
